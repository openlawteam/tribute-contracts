title: ERC1155
---

An [IERC1155Receiver](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) contract manages the collection tokens that are ub the [ERC1155 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), so it can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types in the DAO extension.

In other words, the DAO becomes capable of managing and curating a collection of multi tokens in ERC1155 standard, and it allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.

## Access Flags

- `WITHDRAW_NFT`: Allows the caller to remove the NFT from the GUILD collection and return it to a new owner.
- `INTERNAL_TRANSFER`: Allows the caller to update the internal ownership of the NFT within the GUILD collection.

## Storage

### public initialized

Internally tracks deployment under eip-1167 proxy pattern.

### public dao

Keeps track of each DAO instance the current contract belongs to.

### private \_nfts

Tracks all the Token IDs that belong to an NFT address stored in the GUILD collection.

### private \_nftTracker

Tracks the address of the Owner to the NFT address, the NFT's corresponding Token ID and the Amount of that particular Token Id held by Owner.

### private \_ownership

Tracks the internal owner of record of an NFT that has been transferred to the extension.

### private \_nftAddresses

Tracks all the NFTs addresses collected and stored in the GUILD collection.
