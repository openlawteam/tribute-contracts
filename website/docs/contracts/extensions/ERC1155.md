id: erc1155-extension
title: ERC1155
---

An [IERC1155Receiver](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) contract manages the collection NFTs that are the (ERC1155) standard.

The extension adds to the DAO the capability of managing and curating a collection of ERC1155 standard NFTs.

## Access Flags

- `COLLECT_NFT`: Allows the caller adapter to transfer the NFT to the GUILD collection.
- `WITHDRAW_NFT`: Allows the caller to remove the NFT from the GUILD collection and return it to a new owner.
- `INTERNAL_TRANSFER`: Allows the caller to update the internal ownership of the NFT within the GUILD collection.

## Storage

#### public initialized

Internally tracks deployment under eip-1167 proxy pattern.

#### public dao

Keeps track of each DAO instance the current contract belongs to.

#### private \_nfts

Tracks all the Token IDs that belong to an NFT address stored in the GUILD collection.

#### private \_nftTracker

Tracks the address of the Owner to the NFT address, the NFT's corresponding Token ID and the Amount of that particular Token Id held by Owner.

#### private \_ownership

Tracks the internal owner of record of an NFT that has been transferred to the extension.

#### private \_nftAddresses

Tracks all the NFTs addresses collected and stored in the GUILD collection.
