⚡️ **[TributeDAO Framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts)** provides you a set of modular and extensible smart contracts to launch your DAO with minimal costs.

## Requirements

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** version >= 16.0.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** version 2.15.0 or above.
- **[Solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/installing-solidity.html)** version 0.8.0.

## Creating the project

The easiest way to start with TributeDAO Framework is to use the command line tool to clone the Github repository, and install all the project dependencies.

Clone and access the _tribute-contracts_ Github repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts.git && cd tribute-contracts
```

Fetch and checkout the branch `release-v1.0.4`:

> git fetch origin release-v1.0.4

> git checkout release-v1.0.4

:::caution
Before installing the dependencies make sure you are on the branch [release-v1.0.4](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/releases/tag/v1.0.4) which is the version that contains the contracts integrated with [TributeUI](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-ui).
:::

Install all the project dependencies and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
npm ci && npm run compile
```

⚡️ That's is great! You have installed project dependencies, compiled all the smart contracts, and is prepared to configure the testnet deployment. Let's move to the next section!
