⚡️ **[TributeDAO Framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts)** provides you a set of modular and extensible smart contracts to launch your DAO with minimal costs.

## Requirements

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** version >= 12.12.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** version 2.15.0 or above.
- **[Solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/installing-solidity.html)** version 0.8.0.

## Creating the project

The easiest way to start with TributeDAO Framework is to use the command line tool to clone the Github repository and install all the project dependencies.

Clone and access the Github repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:openlawteam/tribute-contracts.git && cd tribute-contracts
```

:::caution
Make sure you checkout the tag [v1.0.0](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/releases/tag/v1.0.0) which is the version that contains the contracts that work with [TributeUI](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-ui).
:::

```bash
git checkout tags/v1.0.0 -b branch-v1.0.0
```

Install all the project dependencies and compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npm ci && npm run compile
```

The expected output from the compilation process should be:

```bash
...
> Compiling ...
> Artifacts written to ~/tribute-contracts/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.8.0...
```

⚡️ That's is great! You have installed project dependencies, compiled all the smart contracts, and is prepared to configure the testnet deployment. Let's move to the next section!
