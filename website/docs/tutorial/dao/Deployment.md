‚ö°Ô∏è **[TributeDAO Framework](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts)** provides you a set of modular and extensible smart contracts to launch your DAO with minimal costs.

## Requirements

- **[Tribute Contracts](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/release-v2.3.3)** version [release-v2.3.3](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/release-v2.3.3).
- ‚öôÔ∏è All the environment variables must be set in the _.env_ file as indicated in the previous section.

- üí≤ You have ETH in your DAO Owner account (2 ETH should be more than enough).

:::warning
Make sure you are on the branch [release-v2.3.3](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/release-v2.3.3) which is the version that contains the contracts integrated with [TributeUI](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-ui).
:::

## Deploying your DAO

Execute the following command from the root of `tribute-contracts` folder to deploy all the contracts to Rinkeby:

```bash
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```

üç∫ Sit back and have some drink while the deployment script is executed. It may take from 10 to 20 minutes to create all the smart contracts.

:::info
The deployment is slow mainly because we publish all the smart contracts at once, even the ones that are not in use by the DAO or are just test contracts. We certainly don't do that for Mainnet deployments, but we are constantly working to improve the developer experience, and minimize the gas costs.
:::

:::tip
Set `enabled: false` to the contract configuration found in the `tribute-contracts/migrations/configs/contracts.config.ts` file, and that will remove the contract from the deployment. Be mindful on which contracts you are disabling, otherwise your DAO might not be functional.
:::

At the end of the deployment process you should see the following output:

```bash

‚ö°Ô∏è Awesome!! You have deployed your DAO to the **[Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)** test network, and now it is time to interact with it using our dApp called **[Tribute UI](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-ui)**. Checkout the next section to dive into that.
